As part of the CODTECH Internship Program, Task-2 focuses on developing a RESTful API for a library or inventory management system. This task is essential in preparing interns for real-world backend development, emphasizing best practices in designing and implementing modern APIs using CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

The objective of this task is to simulate a scenario that mirrors the requirements of many real-life software development projects. RESTful APIs are the backbone of many applications, from e-commerce platforms to digital libraries. They enable seamless communication between client and server systems by following the REST architectural style and using HTTP protocols.

Interns are required to build a backend application capable of managing resources such as books in a library or items in an inventory. Each resource must be uniquely identifiable and modifiable through HTTP requests. The API should handle standard HTTP methods:

GET for retrieving data,

POST for adding new entries,

PUT/PATCH for updating existing records, and

DELETE for removing entries.

This task encourages the use of any preferred backend technology stack such as Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or Django, or even Java and Spring Boot — giving interns the flexibility to work in environments they are comfortable with or want to explore further. While designing the API, focus must be placed on proper routing, error handling, input validation, and use of appropriate status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error).

Another key deliverable of this task is API documentation. Proper documentation not only demonstrates professionalism but also ensures the API is easy to use and maintain by other developers. Tools like Swagger (OpenAPI), Postman, or even markdown-based docs can be used to document endpoints, request/response formats, and expected behavior.

By the end of the task, interns are expected to submit:

Fully functional API code with working endpoints for CRUD operations.

Complete documentation explaining how to interact with the API.

This assignment nurtures a strong foundation in backend API development and provides practical exposure to software engineering practices. It also helps interns understand how applications exchange data and the significance of structured API development in building scalable systems. Completing this task successfully enhances an intern's portfolio, demonstrating their capability in full-stack or backend development, which is highly valued in the tech industry.

In summary, Task-2 of the CODTECH Internship is not just a coding challenge — it is a structured exercise designed to strengthen the understanding of REST principles, backend logic, and clean code documentation. It’s an ideal opportunity for budding developers to transition from theory to hands-on development, setting the stage for future project work or professional roles in software development.
